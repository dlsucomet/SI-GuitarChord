# The AirGuitar Project

AirGuitar is a research effort under the Seamless Interactions division of the De La Salle University Center for Complexity and Emerging Technologies (DLSU-COMET), advised by Laboratory Head Jordan Aiko Deja.

The current research team is composed of Jan Christian Blaise Cruz (Team lead), Joshua Raphaelle Cruzada, John Edel Tamani (DevOps), and Jolene Valenzuela.

This repository hosts the division of the project dedicated to gesture recognition. In Phase Two, the goal of the project is to determine incoming strumming data as "up" or "down" strums. Machine learning and other analysis techniques are implemented by jan Christian Blaise Cruz.

## Timeline

The team's progress so far:
* **Phase 1** - Inherited from the original team. Aimed to classify the chords used via left hand fingerpositions
* **Phase 2 Preliminaries** - Comparative analysis of machine learning models to best suit the new learning problem (strumming classification). See the preliminary-dev branch for legacy code.
* **Phase 2** - Right hand strumming recognition (Submitting paper to the CHI uxID 2018 conference!)
* **Phase 3** - [COMING SOON] Integration of all phases and construction of actual air guitar prototype

## Built With

* [Fastdtw](https://github.com/slaypni/fastdtw) - Dynamic Time Warping implementation
* All other code developed in-house

## Contributing

Stay tuned for COMET invitations and recruitments if you'd like to join Team AirGuitar or any of our awesome research teams!
